## Development server

Iâ€™m a fan of todo list and i believe they can make our life easier structured.
I believe notion is the best for it, but I need some more visual representative of my progress, some extra feature to see of my learning path progress more clearly. 
So I decide to do this app. Will start with simple MVP and than will update from time to time
